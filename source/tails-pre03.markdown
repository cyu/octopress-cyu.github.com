__*(This page points to an old version of Tails. I've created a new page for the latest version of Tails, which is [here](/tails).)*__

While there are [quite a few Firefox extension/user scripts which handles microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=firefox&amp;go=Go, "Search microformats wiki for Firefox") available out there, most of them just support exporting to their native formats and not adequately display just what microformats a site currently contains.

__Tails__ [microformats](http://microformats.org "Microformats Website") on a webpage.  Currently, this plugin has limited support for the following microformats:

- hCard
- hCalendar
- hReview
- xFolk

Unlike [Smartzilla](http://www.stripytshirt.co.uk/features/firefox/smartzilla "Smartzilla, another microformat extension"), my plugin doesn't support exporting to their native formats - right now I'm more interested in seeing who is using microformats.

You can [install Tails (v0.1.3) here](http://codeeg.com/tails/tails-0-1-3.xpi "Tails Firefox Extension Installation File") (for Firefox 1.5+).

__Flock Users:__ A [Flock version of Tails is now available](/tails/flocktails.html).

__Update:__ [Robert de Bruin](http://bordewolf.blogspot.com/) has extended Tails and added some additional export functionality.  [You can get it here](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2240/).

How It Works
------------

An icon shows when microformats are available on the current page:

<a title="microformats logo in the status bar" href="/images/wp/tails_status.jpg"><img src="/images/wp/tails_status.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="91" /></a>

You can double-click on the icon to show the available microformats on the sidebar:
