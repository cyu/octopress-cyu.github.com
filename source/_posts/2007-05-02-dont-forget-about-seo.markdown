Like <a href="http://blog.aisleten.com/">Micah</a>,  I too was at <a href="http://www.atlanta-web.org/">The Atlanta Web Entrepreneurs</a> meetup listening to John Sherrod talk about Search Engine Optimization as part of my "Resolution 2007: Getting out of My Comfort Zone" tour.  And also like Micah, in the back of my mind I was afraid that I would come out of meetup needing to take a long, take-a-layer-of-skin-off shower to get rid of all the dirty hackery that is SEO, but instead the meeting was a real eye opener.   The most important point I got out of the presentation is that SEO is not as much about getting yourself listed as #1, but more about controlling how you want Google and Google users view your web presence.   In a way, SEO is the web application's equivalent or traditional retail's mantra of 'location, location, location'.

The meetup had quite the strong attendance -- it's nice to see that there are a lot of people out there trying to achieve similar goals.  I did have the pleasure to meet fellow Railer <a href="http://blog.aisleten.com/">Micah</a> and spoke with him about his company <a href="http://aisleten.com">AisleTen</a> and about <a href="http://www.obsidianportal.com/">Obsidian Portal, their </a><a href="http://www.obsidianportal.com/">portal for players of Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>.  If you're into D&amp;D, check it out.    I do have a suggestion for their site though (I was originally going to post it to their forums, but I'd thought I'd make Micah work for it ;) ): try putting the latest campaign post or an excerpt of it on the front page.  That content is too good to have to be digging for it.

For those interested in SEO, John has the <a href="http://www.slimster.net/seo-presentation-in-atlanta/">SEO presentation</a> available on his blog.
