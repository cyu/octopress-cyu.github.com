I've updated <a title="Flocktails Extension for the Flock Browser" href="http://blog.codeeg.com/flocktails-extension/">Flocktails</a> to be work with the latest <a title="The Flock Browser" href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a> beta (v0.7).  Here is a list of the changes:
<ul>
	<li>The Flocktails topbar can now be opened with a single click of the microformats icon in the status bar (it required a double click before).</li>
	<li>Since the mapping topbar went away in this latest Flock release, there is now links to map an hCard or hCalendar on Google Maps or Yahoo! Maps.</li>
	<li>hCard data will now scroll if there is a lot of data to display</li>
	<li>Multiple telephone #'s are now displayed, along with the phone type.</li>
</ul>
Check it out and let me know what you think.  Note that this release is not compatible with any version Flock prior to v0.7.
