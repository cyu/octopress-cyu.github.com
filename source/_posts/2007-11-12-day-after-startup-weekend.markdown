I'm about to head to work after 2 1/2 long days and nights of Startup Weekend, but I wanted to make sure I at least posted something about it.  I'm sure I'll have more to say about it as I replay all the events in head, but overall it was a blast.  It was roller coaster ride of emotions compressed into less than 60 hours, and while there were many moments of frustration over the course of this weekend, it only made the ending so much sweeter.
