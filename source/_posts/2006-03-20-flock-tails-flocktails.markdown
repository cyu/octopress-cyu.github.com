The weekend before last, I took the time and ported my <a href="http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-firefox-extension">Tails Firefox Extension</a> to <a title="Flock Browser" href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a>, the result of which is <a title="Flocktails, A Flock Microformats Extension" href="http://blog.codeeg.com/flocktails-extension">Flocktails</a>.  The biggest improvement was moving the extension from display microformats on the sidebar to Flock's topbar, which makes a very significant visual difference:

<span style="color:#551a8b;text-decoration:underline;"><a href="/images/wp/flocktails_full.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-129" src="/images/wp/flocktails_full.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a></span>

As you can see, I also changed the view to display only one microformat at a time, which now gives me some room to add some extra information/functionality if I chose to.

In other Tails happenings, <a href="http://bordewolf.blogspot.com/2006/03/tails-export-extension.html">Robert de Bruin combined my Tails extension with the export functionality of Smartzilla</a> into one extension, and it looks pretty good, so check it out.
