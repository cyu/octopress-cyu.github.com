Currently, the most popular use of <a title="Learn about microformats" href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a> is to export them to their native formats, (hCards -&gt; vCards and hCalendar -&gt; iCal), but there's really should be more utility for microformats than that.

Here's one neat thing you can do - I created <a title="MyPlaces Application" href="http://myplaces.codeeg.com/">a little application that will allow you plot and describe places on a Yahoo Map easily</a> using the <a title="hreview specification" href="http://www.microformats.org/wiki/hreview">hreview</a> and <a title="geo specification" href="http://www.microformats.org/wiki/geo">geo</a> microformats. Generate the HTML from the application, slap it on your own blog (with your own <a title="Get an Yahoo! Application ID" href="http://api.search.yahoo.com/webservices/register_application">Yahoo! Application ID</a> of course), and away you go.  To modify the web plots, just revise your HTML and reload.

Check it out and let me know what you think.  I used it to plot <a title="My About Page" href="http://blog.codeeg.com/about">some places around my neighborhood where I like to eat</a>.
