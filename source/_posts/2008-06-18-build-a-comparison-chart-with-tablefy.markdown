I found <a href="http://www.tablefy.com/tables/edit/608">Tablefy</a> via Lifehacker last night, which is an application that is very much like <a href="/2006/09/02/interesting-app-ideas.html">one of the ideas I wrote about</a> almost 2 years ago.  It's still rough around the edges (the petfinder captcha is a first for me and is pretty cool, although klunky), but I'm looking forward to using it and seeing what kind of usage can come out of it.
