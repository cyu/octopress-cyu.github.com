It's nice to see that <a title="MacBook Pro's Design" href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/design.html">someone has finally figured out how to fix this nasty problem with laptops</a>.  I've had this happen to two of my laptops, one of which I've fortunately had fixed through work.

Now I just have to convince purchasing (my wife) that it is within our budget.
