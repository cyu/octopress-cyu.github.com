I finally took the time yesterday to roll out a new blog design, as well as upgrade to the latest and greatest version of WordPress.  The theme is derived from <a href="http://powazek.com" title="Derek Powazek's Blog">Derek Powazek</a>'s <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/516" title="DePo Clean WordPress Theme">DePo Clean theme</a>, which I chose for its clean and minimalist design.  The new theme also gave me the opportunity to highlight some of the projects I'm working on, which I'll be posting about in the future.
