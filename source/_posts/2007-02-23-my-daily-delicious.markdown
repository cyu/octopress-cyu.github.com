I've received a couple of inquiries about how I'm doing my daily delicious posts, so today I cleaned up the script a little so I can post about it and send it out.

Basically this script takes <a title="Marc Nozell's post about Yet's Another Daily Delicious Script" href="http://nozell.com/blog/2005/01/30/updated-yet-another-daily-delicious-hack/">Marc Nozell's Yet Another Daily Delicious script</a> (you can find <a title="Marc Nozell's YADD script" href="http://www.nozell.com/marc/blog/data/yadd-1.0.TXT">the original script here</a>) and uses <a title="thumbnail service" href="http://www.websnapr.com/">WebSnapr's</a> thumbnail service so you can see a preview along with my delicious bookmarks.

You can <a title="Daily Delicious script w/ thumbnails" href="https://gist.github.com/812212">download the script here</a>.  Setup instructions are in script.  I only did one quick run through after I made my changes, so if anyone runs into any issues let me know.
