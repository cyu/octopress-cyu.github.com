I was reading <em>Founders at Work</em>, and found this great quote by <a title="Wikipedia article on Philip Greenspun" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Greenspun">Philip Greenspun</a>:
<blockquote>To my mind, a programmer is not an engineer, because an engineer is somebody who starts with a social problem that an organization or a society has and says, "OK, here's this problem that we have-- how can we solve it?" ...

That's engineering.  If you look at civil engineers, architects, they're all dealing directly with the customer and going through the whole process.</blockquote>
It's hard to describe it any better than that.
