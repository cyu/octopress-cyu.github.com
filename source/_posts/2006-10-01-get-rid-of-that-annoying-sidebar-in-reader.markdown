As <a title="My thoughts on Google Reader" href="/2006/09/30/the-new-and-somewhat-improved-google-reader.html">I noted before</a>, I wasn't too crazy with Google Reader's new sidebar.  So I decided to do something about it.  Go out and grab <a title="Greasemonkey" href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> (if you haven't already) and then install <a title="Toggle sidebar greasemonkey script" href="https://gist.github.com/812214">this script</a>.  Here's a screenshot:
