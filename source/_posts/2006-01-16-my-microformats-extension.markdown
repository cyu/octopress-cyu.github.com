In an effort to further understand and explore the potential usefulness of microformats, I've been spending some time <a title="Tails Firefox Extension" href="http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-firefox-extension">creating a Firefox extension</a> that will indicate when a website contains microformats.

Its pretty basic so far (with only support for hCard and hCalendar), but I'm pretty happy with the results.  Developing a Firefox extension is a real PITA, but very rewarding when you see the results in action.
