After some tweaking of a graph originally created by a member of the <a title="Straight-Talking Java" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/straight_talking_java/">ST-J Java Group</a>, this is what I think is the most accurate representation of 2005:

<span style="color:#0000ee;text-decoration:underline;"><a class="imagelink" title="2005 SD Job Trends Graph" href="/images/wp/jobgraph.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-131" src="/images/wp/jobgraph_small.png" alt="" width="450" height="250" /></a></span>

This graph was creating using <a title="Job Search Site Indeed.com" href="http://www.indeed.com">Indeed.com</a>'s <a title="Job trends graphing tool" href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=java+software%2Cc+software%2Cc%2B%2B+software%2Cc%23+software%2Cruby+software%2Csmalltalk+software%2C.net+software">niftly Job Trends tool</a>.  What does it say?  Not much really - to me it seems as though the software development market is pretty healthy.

And what about Ruby?   I'm not sure it reveals anything - I suspect that its flatness has more to do with the hiring behavior of Ruby shops than anything else.
