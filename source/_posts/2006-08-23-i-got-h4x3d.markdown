Imagine my surprise when just few minutes ago I did a (Windows Key + M) to show my desktop and <a title="funny image from Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimlahey/222544043/">got this message</a>.  It took me a little while before I noticed the Safari window trimmings and realized what I was looking at.

Since creating my Flickr background script, I've seen some amazing photos that took my breath away, but this one actually made my heart to skip a beat.
