I was lucky in enough to get invited into the closed <a title="Intense Debate website" href="http://www.intensedebate.com">Intense Debate</a> a few weeks ago, and after a stumble here and there I was able to get the ID plugin installed and working on this blog.  Now all new comments be going to be handled by Intense Debate instead of WordPress.

In case you don't know what Intense Debate is, it's a blog comment service that can hook into MovableType, WordPress, and Blogger.  It enhances the old comment system by adding things like threaded conversations, reputations, and avatars, but also allows me to keep track of my comments and my friends comments -- provided that they are commenting on blogs that use the Intense Debate comment system.  Checkout <a title="My Intense Debate profile" href="http://www.intensedebate.com/users/444">my Intense Debate profile page</a> to get a sense of what ID can do.

Please give the plugin a test drive -- post a comment and tell me what you think.
