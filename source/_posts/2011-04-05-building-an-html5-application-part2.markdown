title: 'Building an HTML5 Application, Part 2: Web Notifications &amp; &lt;Audio&gt;'
---

This is part 2 in a series of posts walking through my experiences building [Thymer](http://blog.sourcebender.com/thymer), a single-page web application using HTML5 and related technologies.  In [my first post](building-an-html5-application-part1.html), I got the basics of the application working and used the Local **Storage API** to store timers between browser refreshes.  In this article, I'm going to talk about the **Notification API** and the **&lt;audio&gt;** tag.

The Notification API
--------------------
Since my last post, I've made some minor fixes and UI tweaks to get Thymer feeling more like a usable application, but Thymer really wasn't going to be useful unless it can grab a user's attention when a timer ends.  Recently Gmail introduced a new feature in Chrome where I get a nice little Growl-like notification whenever I received a Google Talk message.  This was done using something called the Notification API.  I wanted to see how easy it would be use this API to show a notification when a timer completes.

The Notification API is currently just a [draft spec](http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/desktop-notifications/api-specification), and it's support is currently only limited to Chrome.  Once the API gets wider adoption, there's a very good chance the API will change (at the minimum to rename the _window.webkitNotifications_ object).  Getting it working was super easy, basically by following [this tutorial here](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/notifications/quick/).

First, I request permission to use the Notifications API when the first timer is created.  It's important to note that **you can only request permission on a user triggered event like a mouse click or key event.**  In Thymer's case, I request permission when the Enter key is pressed to submit a new timer:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#add-timer-form input').keypress(function(event) {
  if (event.which == '13') { // Enter key
    event.preventDefault();
    var seconds = parseInt($('#secs').val()) +
        (parseInt($('#mins').val()) * 60) +
        (parseInt($('#hours').val()) * 60 * 60);

    Thymer.addTimer(new Timer($('#timer-name').val(), seconds));
    $('#timer-name').val('');

    // request notifications permission if API is supported.  We do
    // this here because we can only do this on user triggered events.
    if (window.webkitNotifications &&
          window.webkitNotifications.checkPermission() != 0) {
      window.webkitNotifications.requestPermission();
    }
  }
})
{% endhighlight %}

Then I create a notification when the timer ends:

{% highlight javascript %}
_alarm:function() {
  // show a notification if the browser supports it.
  if (window.webkitNotifications &&
      window.webkitNotifications.checkPermission() == 0) {

    window.webkitNotifications.createNotification('clock_32x32.png',
        'Thymer', '"' + this.name + '" timer has completed').show();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's what the notification looks like:

Some notes about the Notifications API:

1. I had issues with _requestPermission()_ when using the _file://_ protocol where my permission got set as if I denied permission and didn't give me a way to reset it.  If you're testing locally I recommend serving your page via localhost.
2. Once you approve or deny the notification permission, users will not receive the permission infobar again when you call _requestPermission()_.  You can reset the permission in Chrome from **Preferences** > **Under the Hood** > **Content Settings** (Under _Privacy_).
3. The image parameter in _createNotification()_ is not optional.  Passing **null** will show a broken image.

The Audio Tag
-------------
So now I have a way to grab user's attention when a timer completes in Chrome, but what about other browsers?  How about playing an alarm sound when the timer completes?  This turned out to be pretty easy with the **&lt;audio&gt;** tag:

{% highlight html %}
<audio id=alarm-sound>
  <source src=alarm.mp3 type=audio/mpeg />
  <source src=alarm.ogg type=audio/ogg />
  <source src=alarm.wav type=audio/wav />
</audio>
{% endhighlight %}

This sets up a audio clip that I can access from JavaScript via the element id.  Since I don't specify a **controls** or **autoplay** attribute, the audio won't play until I want it to.  I'm also specifying the three different sources for audio (gotta love proprietary sound formats).  Between MP3 &amp; Ogg Vorbis, all modern browsers should be covered, but I'm going to throw a WAV in there for completeness anyway.  I am concerned about how this will affect my footprint when I setup offline mode for Thymer, but that's an issue for a different post.

Playing the audio from JavaScript is cake:

{% highlight javascript %}
_alarm:function() {
  // show a notification if the browser supports it.
  if (window.webkitNotifications && window.webkitNotifications.checkPermission() == 0) {
    window.webkitNotifications.createNotification('clock_32x32.png', 'Thymer', '"' + this.name + '" timer has completed').show();
  }

  // play the alarm sound
  document.getElementById('alarm-sound').play();
}
{% endhighlight %}

For more information about the Audio tag, I recommend [this article at &lt;html&gt;5doctor](http://html5doctor.com/native-audio-in-the-browser/).  In that article they have a helpful table showing the browser support for the different audio formats.

This concludes Part 2 of this series.  You can [see the final code for this part here](https://github.com/cyu/thymer/tree/part2).  You can also see the final application on [the master branch](https://github.com/cyu/thymer) as well as play with a [running version of Thymer here](http://blog.sourcebender.com/thymer).  In part 3, I'm going to configure Thymer to run in offline mode by creating a cache manifest.
