In addition to fixing a bug with uninstalling Tails Scripts (thanks to <a href="http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-firefox-extension-03/?preview=true#comment-1529">CÃ©dric</a> for finding this), I've also added a details view for viewing all the fields of a microformat (just click on the bolded object label in the object list).

To get this update, you'll have go to the <a title="Tails Project Page" href="http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-firefox-extension-03/">Tails home page</a> and manually download it.  I'm holding off the automatic update until I have had more time to play with it.  Please post any issues by commenting to this post or on the Tails home page, or by creating an issue on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tails-firefox-extension/issues/list">Tails project page hosted by Google Code</a>.

In addition to this update, I've also added a Tails script to <a title="Technorati This Tails Script" href="http://codeeg.com/tails/scripts/technorati.tails.js">search for inbound links to blog entries via Technorati</a> and <a title="Socialmeter Tails Script" href="http://codeeg.com/tails/scripts/socialmeter.tails.js">a script to check a blog entry or bookmark for popularity using Socialmeter</a>.

Here's a screenshot of the object details view:
