For the most part, <a title="Dynamic language, refactoring IDE. Pick one." href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000414.html">I agree with Cedric</a>:
<blockquote>One of the main reasons why people like dynamically typed languages is precisely because they don't have to specify these types. Is it really so shocking that this convenience comes at the price of not being able to perform any operation that requires type information on this code?</blockquote>
This problem has always reminded me of the 'Help me help you!' scene in <em>Jerry Maguire</em> - if you don't tell your IDE your intentions, then there is always going to be limits to what your IDE is going to be able to do for you.

Having said that, it took a couple of years of JBuilder,  Netbeans, and Visual Age before we got the great refactoring capabilities of Eclipse and IntelliJ.  I would not be at all surprised if someone out there figures out a good solution to this problem.
