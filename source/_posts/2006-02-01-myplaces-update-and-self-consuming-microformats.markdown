I took the effort and modified the <a title="Plot your favorite locations with MyPlaces" href="http://myplaces.codeeg.com/">MyPlaces</a> script to support both the Yahoo! and Google Maps APIs.  I also fixed a problem with the generator application not working in IE.

I like the idea of having a webpage consume its own microformat - whereas common usage of microformats indirectly benefit the author (through aggregation), with this script I was able to provide immediate benefit to the author for using microformats.  Maybe the key to more widespread adoption is to provide more apparent benefit for authors.
