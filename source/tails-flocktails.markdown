__*Flocktails has been consolidated into the Tails Extension as of version 0.3.  You can download the [latest version of Tails here](/tails).*__

Not to leave [Flock](http://www.flock.com "Flock Browser") out in the cold, I've ported my [Tails Extension](/tails/pre03.html) to Flock, which I'm calling Flocktails.   Flocktails supports the same microformats (hCard, hCalendar, hReview, xFolk) as the original Tails Extension, but displays them one at a time and from Flock's topbar (click on the image below to see the the full image):
